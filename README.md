# Tracker
A Grasshopper plugin for NaturalPoint's NatNet API. Supports real-time motion tracking with OptiTrack camera systems. 

Requires a valid copy of the OptiTrack Motive software to broadcast MoCap data on a local network.
Tracker grabs frame data from Motive, scales, translates and presents the relevant Rhino Geometry inside Grasshopper. Using basic interaction, this can be used for tracking tools, calibrating and tracking robotics applications, structural materials testing and much more.
